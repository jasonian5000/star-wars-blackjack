# Welcome to Star Wars Blackjack!

## Overview
--
Star Wars Blackjack is a Star Wars themed blackjack game done in html, css, and javascript. This was originally part of an assignment from the [DigitalCrafts](https://www.digitalcrafts.com/) software developer bootcamp. The assignment was to make a simple blackjack game to demonstrate our logic skills in JavaScript and make it a web app to demonstrate a basic understanding of HTML/CSS.  I enjoyed making it so much that I decided to give a Star Wars theme as well as add additional functions like choosing the number of decks to deal, tracking wins and loses, and making wagers.
